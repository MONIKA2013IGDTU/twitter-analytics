In the context of opinion mining, sarcasm represents a new challenge. 
Sarcasm is anuanced form of speech where the intended meaning is in direct opposition to the stated utterance.
Sarcasm detection is generally perplexing, not just due to the intentional ambiguity of sarcasm but also the fact that it is narrowly located and verycontextual.
This is compounded by high regional variation in sarcasm and absence ofsimilar occurrences.
Identification of sarcasm and the accompanying polarity detection can be beneficial for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems.
We create a supervised sarcasm detection framework based on a corpus of Twitter data.
The tweets pertain to Government of India schemes whose analysis provides valuable insights into the reaction of people toward governmental actions allowing for constant improvement in government backed services. 
Through this study we intend to propose an efficient way to detect sarcastic tweets, and study how to use this information to enhance the accuracy of sentiment analysis.
Such social sentiment analysis can help the administration become more responsive to peopleâ€™s concerns.
To achieve the aforementioned we undertake a comparative study of various features associated with sarcasm like emotions,punctuation marks, etc.
We also perform a comparative study of various classifiers like kNN, SVM, RandomForest etc.
Finally, we examine the added value/combined result of the different sets of features used in terms of precision of detection.
